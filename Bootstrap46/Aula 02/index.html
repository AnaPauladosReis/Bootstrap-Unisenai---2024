	 <p class="h1 text-primary">Once upon a time, a very long time ago now, about last Friday, Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of Sanders. ("What does 'under the name' mean?" asked Christopher Robin.</p>

	<p class="h2 text-success">"It means he had the name over the door in gold letters, and lived under it." "Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't quite sure," said Christopher Robin. "Now I am," said a growly voice. "Then I will go on," said I.)</p>

	<p class="h3 text-info">One day when he was out walking, he came to an open place in the middle of the forest, and in the middle of this place was a large oak-tree, and, from the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.</p> 

	<p class="h4 text-warning">Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between his paws and began to think. First of all he said to himself: "That buzzing-noise means something. You don't get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning something.</p>

	<p class="h4 text-danger"><strong>If there's a buzzing-noise, somebody's making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise that I know of is because you're a bee." Then he thought another long time, and said: "And the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making honey." And then he got up, and said: "And the only reason for making honey is so as I can eat it." So he began to climb the tree.</strong></p>

	<p class="h5 text-muted"><em>He climbed and he climbed and he climbed, and as he climbed he sang a little song to himself. It went like this: Isn't is funny how a bear likes honey? Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! I wonder why he does?</em></p>
	
	<p class="h1 text-primary p-3">“People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day.”</p>
	
	<p class="h2 text-success p-4">“I think we dream so we don’t have to be apart for so long. If we’re in each other’s dreams, we can be together all the time.”</p>
